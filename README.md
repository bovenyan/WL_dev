# _WikkitDev_

Welcome to the repository for IOT R&D Platform for WikkitLabs (WikkitDev). WikkitDev supports the status monitoring and app upgrades of Wikkit Sensors, which plays the critcal role in the Internet of Things projects in WikkitLabs. For operators, the platform enables remotely monitoring the sensors, adjusting the physical or logical states of the sensors, and receiving alert of anomalies. For developers, the platform enables fetching testing data, running scheduled testing apps, upgrade or roll back apps running on the sensors. 

## Setup

WikkitDev has three different modules: client is deployed on any PC devices, server is deployed on a cloud-hosting server with public IP/domain, device is deployed on any models of Wikkit Sensors. The guide for deploying each module is presented as follows,

1. see [Client Deployment Guide]
2. see [Server Deployment Guide]
3. see [Device Deployment Guide](http://github.com/bovenyan/WL_dev/device/CONFIG_GUIDE.md)
